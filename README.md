[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/889562a17e174c438fd56d35780822b0)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/g0d/Specter-AAL/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=g0d/Specter-AAL&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Specter - Abstract Arithmetics Library (AAL) is a library coded in native C which is able to do operations with numbers of virtually unlimited length and precision. The scope and architecture of AAL is different from any other implementation because it is hardware (architecture) and bit (endianness) agnostic. Alo, AAL supports all real positive and negative numbers like decimals and integers.

For now though, the only functional math operations are addition and subtraction but in the future it will be able to run all other major operations.
